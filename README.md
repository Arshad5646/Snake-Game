# Snake-Game
The Snake Game built on Java and Swing is a classic and entertaining implementation of the popular retro arcade game. Developed with a combination of Java programming language and Swing GUI library, this game offers a nostalgic experience with modern functionalities. 
Players control a snake that moves around the screen, consuming food pellets to grow longer. The objective is to keep the snake moving and avoid colliding with the walls or body. As the game progresses, the snake becomes longer, making it increasingly challenging to navigate through the maze.

Responsive Controls: The game boasts smooth and responsive controls, allowing players to guide the snake with precision, the game over if it collides with walls and its own tail.

Increased Difficulty: As the score increases, the snake's length increases and the ability to control the snake becomes difficult.
